# Web chat language configuration

## Overview

This folder contains [ICU Message Format](http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/messages) JSON representations of all of the languages that are supported by the web chat widget. Web chat defaults to English (US), but you can customize this by either selecting one of the out of the box languages, or supplying your own. See [the language and internationalization documentation](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/carbon-chat.html#languages).

We encourage and accept new language submissions!
